Personal Website
## Overview
Welcome to my project! This is a web application built using various technologies to create a functional and user-friendly website. The purpose of this project is to showcase my skills in web development and demonstrate my ability to create a dynamic and interactive website.

## Folder and File Structure
The project is organized into frontend and backend folders, each containing the necessary files. Please ensure that you have the correct package.json files and .env files in the respective folders.

## Global Navigation
The global navigation of the website is designed to provide easy access to different pages. The global Nav.js component includes links to the following pages: Home, Log, Topics, Gallery, Staff, and Order.

## Style
The website is designed with attention to style and readability. The page layout blocks have adequate spacing between the borders/edges and content/text, ensuring a visually pleasing experience. Color contrast in paragraphs, lists, tables, and forms is carefully considered to facilitate easy reading.

## Home Page
The Home page serves as the main landing page of the website. It should provide a warm welcome to the users and include informative content describing the technologies utilized in the development of the website. Ensure that the heading and paragraph(s) accurately describe the technologies such as HTML, CSS, icons, Express, Google Fonts, JavaScript, MongoDB, Mongoose, Node, optimized images, React, and REST.

## Log Page
The Log page is an essential component of the website. It includes a header, a descriptive paragraph, and a Create button. Additionally, there is an icon that allows users to navigate to the Create page upon clicking.

## Create Page
The Create page is where users can input data through a table with accessible form controls. Users can enter strings, numbers, and dates, and all fields should be required. After clicking the Save button, users should be redirected back to the Log page to view the newly created data.

## Log Page Retrieval
The Log page is capable of retrieving all documents from a table. Each row in the table provides Edit and Delete icons to enable users to interact with the data.

## Edit Page
The Edit page allows users to modify existing documents. It contains a table with pre-populated data, enabling users to make changes and save them. After saving, users are redirected back to the Log page to view the updated data. Please verify that the Edit page has been implemented properly according to the specifications.

## Topics Page
The Topics page provides web development writing and optional local navigation.

## Backend Methods
The project involves the use of Model and Controller files to perform CRUD operations on a MongoDB collection using Mongoose and Express. It includes appropriate status codes for success, client-side errors, and server-side errors. The console and/or alert() functions display these status codes and messages.
