            <h2>Welcome to my website!</h2>
            <p>The basic building blocks of this website are created using HTML. HTML is the backbone of the website, but the other technologies provide a lot of the functionality.
                CSS is mainly for the design and formatting of the website, allowing it to look consistent in look and feel and appeal to the user. I also incorporate custom icons and Google fonts
                by importing them from the web. The icons can be used as buttons on different pages to provide functionality. I use Express to fuel the backend of my site and provide a framework for Node. 
                I also incorporate JavaScript to allow the user to interact with different forms on the site, and by using MongoDB and Mongoose, data can be stored for extensive use. When I include images in the site,
                I ensure that their file size and format are optimized for the fastest loading times and best experience for the user. I use React to construct the frontend experience in an organized manner. Finally, I 
                create a line of communication between the frontend and backend using REST APIs.
            </p>
